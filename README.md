Step 2: Put the usermat. f into ANSYS, and then relink ANSYS.    
Step 3: Set the physical parameters of the material, including strain damage threshold and strain damage limit, to simulate the damage of the material.
## 3 User defined material
Define 6 parameters of the brittle material, corresponding to EMD, ENU, Etf, Etu, Ecf, and Ecu in the usermat. f. For example：    
Tb,user,1,1,6    
Tbdata,1,300e8,0.2,0.0003,0.0033,0.0008,0.0023    
Tb,state,1,,1
